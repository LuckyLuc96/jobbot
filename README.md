# Jobbot - An automated Job Application Assistant

Jobbot is a program written in Python and using Selenium and is designed to automate the process of applying for jobs on Indeed. It uses the Firefox WebDriver to interact with the web pages, filling out forms and clicking buttons just as a human user would.

## Features
- Opens the Indeed website and searches for jobs based on specified criteria.
- Automatically clicks the "Apply now" button and handles the application process.
- Continuously checks for "Continue" or "Submit your application" buttons to complete the application.
- Handles scrolling to ensure elements are in view before interacting with them.
- Includes error handling and cleanup to close the browser after the process is complete.

## Setup
*Setup instructions will go here.*
This should hopefully be made easy for the end user when I put this into a docker container



## Todo List
- [ ] Add detailed setup instructions.
- [ ] Implement Docker container for easier deployment.
- [ ] Improve error handling and logging.
- [ ] Allow user input for job search criteria.
